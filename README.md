# Microbe-bridged Disease-metabolite Associations prediction by Heterogeneous Graph Fusion

### Introduction
In this study, we integrate some databases and extracted a variety of associations data among microbes, metabolites, and diseases. After obtaining the trilateral association data (microbe-metabolite, metabolite-disease, and disease-microbe), we consider building a heterogeneous graph to describe the association data. In our model, microbes are used as a bridge between diseases and metabolites. In order to fuse the information of disease-microbe-metabolite graph, we use the bipartite graph attention network on the disease-microbe and metabolite-microbe bigraph.
